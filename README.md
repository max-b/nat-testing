# nat-testing

This is just a proof of concept demonstrating how one could use docker/docker-compose networking to create a testbed for evaluating NAT traversal for the snowflake protocol.

## Concepts
This creates 2 hosts, one running a [snowbox](https://github.com/cohosh/snowbox) container and one running some very simple iptables and routing rules which make it into a NAT router:

I'm not actually super familiar with various NAT implementations, but I _believe_ that they could be implemented with iptables. 

[This answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/28525022/1787596) seems to outline the iptables rules that would implement various NAT strategies, but I haven't thoroughly evaluated it and would need to do more research. 

If it's not possible to implement the full variety of NAT strategies with iptables this is an extremely flawed approach ðŸ™ƒ.


Ultimately, I think it would be more straightforward to actually have each component of the snowflake topology running in its own container:

## Setup
The [.env](./.env) file currently holds all of the configurable values. 

At the moment, before running, you'll need to fill out the paths to your [snowflake-webext](https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/snowflake-webext.git) and [snowflake](https://gitweb.torproject.org/pluggable-transports/snowflake.git) local repositories.

You'll also have to specify your own user id and group id.

[snowbox](https://github.com/cohosh/snowbox) is currently configured as a git submodule, so after cloning this repo, update submodules:
```
$ git submodule update --init
```

## Running
First start the nat-router:
```
$ docker-compose up -d nat-router
```

Then start the snowbox container:
```
$ docker-compose up -d snowbox
```

Each of these containers have start scripts specified in their docker-compose definitions which setup networking and then simply `sleep infinity`. 

This is a just a hacky and temporary way to allow for manual exploration on the `snowbox` container:
```
$ docker-compose exec snowbox /bin/bash
$ su snowflake
$ script.sh -b
$ script.sh -c
```

I wasn't super familiar with the build scripts, so I attempted to leave them as is, especially since this is more of a sandbox POC.

I'm not 100% sure they work correctly at the moment, but I wanted to just demonstrate the idea of the network testbed.
